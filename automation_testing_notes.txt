CI - Continuous Integration 
CD - Continuous Devlivery
CD - Continuous Deployment -> Only if is completely automated


-> everything has to be virtual and automated -> cannot automate physical
- SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) - all the stages of development before it is usable by user.
-> normally done manually, but DevOps is trying to make these processes automated through virtual environments.
-> when your feature code is ready to be moved to dev, we must find a way to test that code to make sure the code does not break dev code -> we can test this without human interaction by creating an automated test server. -> This is known as Continuous Integration. ** KEY **

- Jenkins is the most popular automated test server. -> open source, that automatically tests code as pushed using a feature called 'web hooks', if it fails will return error to user, otherwise will pass and be accepted and integrated into branch.
-> merge conflicts will be reported as an error, which then will need to be manually resolved between team.
-> Jenkins test parameters should be defined by your tests teams.

- Multiple test levels, testing your feature, then testing your merge into dev to see how it works as a whole.

-> reason we have multiple branches is so we will always have some working code to show customer/product owner, and then we can continuously add features to it -> This provides continuous delivery of a product.
   -->> NEVER have broken code in master or you will be FIRED.

-> If all of this is automated, it is then continuous deployment.

- Jenkins essentially works as its own OS, can be set with all types of automated process, not just testing. -> most companies just use it as the standard automation tool, not even for testing. -> can be set to automatically notify someone when some code is pulled, a page is accessed, etc.
- When creating a project, the name must always be as detailed as possible.

-> build triggers defines what events will trigger defined actions/alerts.
